" before , if you want to interview people from the british national party , would have been very difficult to identify them . "
" facebook does this all - you to contact him directly . "
recent research by dr. megan moreno from the university of wisconsin , madison , and her colleagues found that students who talked about their drunken exploits on facebook , were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent about it .

he was , of course , a designer , мечтателем and regarded themselves as hippies , but he was also meticulous organizer and modernizer of the production process , who believed that many business leaders have suffered from the disease to think that really great idea is 90 percent of the work ... [ but ] a great idea from the great product separates a large number of ingenious labour . "
by that time , about 10 years have passed since jobs from apple , and he had already worked out in his new computer company next in anticipation of the mass of the internet .
only after the death of jobs a vhs copy of the director was found in the garage .
for a man known for his hatred of detailed interviews , jobs seems to be here quite ready to present their technological philosophy and business strategy .
in four different points during an interview there are large intervals between questions and answers - where jobs is clearly weighing on 10-15 seconds , their thoughts to say .
in filmed before the age of пиксара айподов айфонов lost interview , there is something uncannily prophetic , when jobs estimates that , as he sees different companies make right and wrong , and offers its own vision for information technology .
he has a vision of how things could and should have been .
" during the period of time in the business i constantly asked : " why are you doing this ? " and the answers you invariably get : " oh , it is just that . "
by way of recording expenses , often начинавшейся expenditure with the " standard " , which took from the ceiling and then подгонялись with " clarification " , he has created automated structure , which guaranteed that they will be able to track business expenses until the details .
jobs in detail about " blue box , " which he has fewer with steve wozniak , a device that allowed people to effectively plasmid long - distance telephone company and calls for free .
he tells how he and wozniak tested the box , using the telephone - machine , when the conversation and then подсоединяясь from one of the at&t network to another , until it had as much as possible .
" we were young , and all that we have learned is that we can build something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world . "
jobs continues to describe a famous escapade , in detail with which he and wozniak almost fulfilled by calling the vatican through blue box at midnight , and asking to call the pope , struggling to henry kissinger 's copy .
about the love of technology ( and cold прозванивании bill хьюлетта ) :
soon after their 20 - minute telephone conversation jobs received a year подработку in hewlett - пакард .
jobs later became one of the hp employees , who visited the company 's research lab in palo alto , where he saw " the first desktop computer . "
i often went to the hp as a teenager and revolved around the car and wrote for her program .
in several places in an interview with jobs to talk about inventing new products on the fly .
while only 30 days in the credit , he had to think and assembly and delivery of ready - made devices .
" i remember the fierce debate ... they were shouting at me , is that it only takes five years [ to mouse , which will cost $ 300 ] , and i was fed by the throat , and came out , and found a designer . "
" let 's say you 're in the ibm or xerox , which is why you 're doing is the best copier and printer , or that ? "
sales and marketing make it more successful , so [ it 's those types of people ] who eventually comes to companies and people , making the product of the decision - makers .
he could be ten times more , could be майкрософтом early ...
you need to keep in mind 5,000 these concepts , ideas - them all together .
part of what made the famous mac , was that people who worked on him , were musicians , poets , artists , зоологами , historians , which happened to be the best specialists in information technology in the world .

nothing new : two judges attend the event of federalists for many years .
in fact , the judges are free from the code of conduct that governs the actions of the lower federal judges .
however , the apparent closeness scalia and thomas to two law firms in this case , as well as the company with large financial interests , was enough signal to the activists of ethics in government .
" judges wined and dined on the official campaign fundraising with lawyers , which now covers the court . "
scalia and thomas , is unlikely to pay attention to the critics who say they are very willing to mix business with the court фигурирующими in groups like the federalist society .
moreover , conservatives argue that this is about justice elena kagan is an ethical question , scalia and thomas .
her critics were demanding that kagan refused a hearing on this case , because it was too involved in the protection of the law , then , to be an impartial now .

" asia can be protected to some extent , but it may not be immune . "
the european monetary union was undermined by the european debt crisis in recent months .
unfolding in europe 's debt crisis has spawned fears that he could bring the world economy into recession again , and led to calls for the leading emerging economies come together to help the eurozone find a solution .
anand sharma , india 's trade minister , said that " india will do everything that can " to help the eurozone , as its own economy is now declining exports and inflows of foreign capital .
" we have ambitious goals , and we must maintain a high level of growth . "
others argue that there is no sense for emerging economies like india to help wealthy europeans , when they are faced with their own deep economic problems .

defense secretary leon panetta tempers in congress on monday , warning that the automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and the financial chain reaction of the pentagon corridors to the fields of battle in afghanistan on the line and civil assembly .
" the impact these cuts would be devastating for the state department , " panetta said in a letter to senators республиканке республиканцу john mccain , arizona and lindsey graham of south carolina .
" so , will make such a strong decline , the majority of our construction projects on кораблестроению and unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or buildings -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes will undermine the credibility of those who support our army and will seriously damage combat readiness . "
" while foreign military financing in the emergency operations does not directly affected секвестром , the military to be severely affected by serious breakdown in the main budgets , " panetta warned .
" staff personnel will be reduced , leading to опозданиям with military suppliers , and legal and political support will be broken . "
" the consequences of sequestration in the department of defense will be a rapid decline in the united states as the world 's leading military power . "
" this is not an option , with which we live in , and this is not an option that we need to impose ourselves . "
whether panetta letter or recent warnings from senators will lead to the pentagon 's budget compromise or strengthen calls for release from cutbacks , will see later .
at a press conference last week , secretary of defense painted a gloomy picture of what may be more troops -- with shell , but without the core .
" it 's a paper tiger , the army to barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said in his introductory remarks in the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could also face obstacles , including those who have already been testing and some in the early stages of planning .
to further develop and test f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say that this is a vital next step to improve and to counter potential threats , china and other opponents .
a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows just how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in everyday life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged in лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly attempted to hide that a retired football coach raping boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was charged in the financial machinations during the campaign - related укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories of fraud on the tests in school and college is the norm .
mentors who should teach the opposite , send a message that the lies and fraud are acceptable .
in a single day , studies show that you can lie from 10 to 200 times .
another study showed that strangers солгали three times for the first 10 minutes to get acquainted with each other .
in contrast to the game room , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " to detect lies is a serious of knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , particularly in psychology and physiology .
not from this hard to notice and it is difficult to draw the conclusion that liars .
i spent several years , the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lie detection , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn , and that helps in our complex in the world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or management .
we know from research that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , that men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lie that they say , often наглая ) .
watch asphyxia , laughed , voice of your property .
rats can fix the upper part of his body , when they try to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , to change its position in a certain way , or " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complex issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use the disengagement in the speech : " i 've never had sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky ... " or repeat the question entirely .
someone can use the " qualification " language , when answering a question : " well ... the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know . "
there is no magical means to detect lies , but to master the skill of deception detection .

in the study population ( anything or not ) invited to take part , sports centres , mssi participating in the study , in the valley of mexico city , where every saturday from 8:00 a.m. , will be carried out tests with the participation of children .
after the goal is to attract from 500 to 600 children achieved independence , the study will continue in the sports center ( mexico ) and , finally , the sports center morelos ( north of mexico city ) .
on november 14 , will be celebrated world diabetes day , and the goal is to collect three thousands of children and adolescents aged 6 to 14 years with his parents ' and under their supervision to individual applications on nutrition .
he explained that on saturday will be held антропометрические measurement of all participants ( height , weight and waist girth ) , measuring blood pressure , glucose and fats , cholesterol and insulin and genetic analysis to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity ) .
in medical research , conducted in the period from 1999 to 2006 , says that there was just 6 years growth : in the case of boys 77 percent were obese , in the case of girls 47 % ; when it comes to weight , there is also experienced significant growth , " said specialist mssi .

рафаель эррера , a researcher at the department of chemical , unam , has developed a polymer - bitumen modified to produce a mixture of the best quality , sustainable to the impact of environmental and temperature .
in his lecture in technological view of the pits , as part of the international year of chemistry , said that laboratory , for which he is responsible for developing polymer - modified bitumen mixed with characteristics close to the bitumen production , but with the best opposition both at high , and at low temperatures .
he explained that the bitumen , the most difficult part of the oil is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules , some high - molecular weight , called асфальтенами , and other low - molecular weight called мальтенами road , which together give to his typical вязкоупругое behavior .
this means that the resistance street asphalt is not constant , and changes in the day , depending on the natural conditions and temperature , said an expert in chemical engineering .
among the top of the layers of bitumen is made of small stones , опущенных спрессованных bitumen and then .
a movement of vehicles and latch effort , it helps to be very well on the road to cover .
the асфальтовом surface , he added , is the last layer , called a layer of wear and tear , which is made of small stone , sand and immersed in the asphalt .
as part of the pavement , which will receive and distribute these efforts , wear also requires the proper thickness , and must be taken into account material from which he is .
when the earth crude , water seeps into the body and it 's hard for her to go from there , it causes размягчение all sections of the coverage and , therefore , yam .

although the german model , based on renewable energy , sometimes cited as an example , the reality belies this argument .
